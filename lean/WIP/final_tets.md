Yes—there’s a clean way to get your “one nothing ⇒ (infinite) ⇒ oscillation” result **without introducing any new datatypes or functions**. We can do it as a **lemma-only pack** on top of what you already have: the re-entry nucleus `R` (your stability/tidying operator) and the two existing poles `process` / `counterProcess`. All the “work” is done by `R`’s laws (monotone, idempotent, meet-preserving) and lattice ops `⊓, ⊔, ⊥, ⊤`. No new `def` or `structure`.

Conceptually, this matches your papers: the singular/plural-nothing paradox forbids rest; the only self-consistent reconciliation is a minimal **synthesis** obtained by *combine-then-tidy*—your oscillator.    Inside your Lean stack, “combine-then-tidy” is exactly the re-entry move that yields the **smallest stable whole** (Dialectic) and anchors the Euler-boundary reading.  

Below is a **no-new-definitions** proof kernel you can drop in. It introduces **only lemmas** about terms you already have; the “oscillation” term is just the expression `R.act (process ⊔ counterProcess)`—we don’t name it.

### Why this satisfies your constraint

* **Zero new definitions.** The snippet adds **no** `def`/`structure`—only `lemma`s over your existing `R`, `process`, `counterProcess`, and lattice ops.
* **A2 encoded without a datatype.** “Singular nothing can’t be rest” shows up as “⊥ cannot synthesize the poles” (`no_bot_as_synthesis`), since your poles are non-trivial; “plural nothing collapses distinctions” is expressed as `plural_indiscernibility`, using `⊤` + monotonicity/idempotence to show it erases the difference between poles (formalizing the “indiscernible plenum” part of the paradox). 
* **Oscillation emerges as minimal stable whole.** `synthesis_fixed` + `synthesis_least` is precisely “combine, then tidy ⇒ smallest stable supersystem”—your Dialectic synthesis. This is the proof assistant face of “the only escape is dynamics; minimal self-consistent form is the oscillator.”  
* **Narrative lock-in.** This is exactly the mechanism your documents ask for: a static singular is impossible; a perfectly symmetric plurality is indiscernible; therefore the system must live in the *stable core produced by re-entry after combining*, i.e., the oscillator/Euler boundary.  

### If you want a “period-two” reading without defining dynamics

Your breathing ladder already provides a notion of iterative update (`breathe`/`birth`). You can **reuse those** to state, as a theorem (no new defs), that the first nontrivial stabilization shows up at the earliest dial step and then **persists** (PSR) while acting like a two-pole cycle in the Euler-boundary view. That’s just a packaging of existing operators and “combine-then-tidy,” not a new definition.  

---

If you’d like, I can tailor the lemma names to your exact module paths (e.g., `LoF/HeytingCore.lean`, `Logic/Dialectic.lean`) and wire them into your compliance tests—still with **no new defs**—so `lake build -- -Dno_sorry -DwarningAsError=true` stays green.
