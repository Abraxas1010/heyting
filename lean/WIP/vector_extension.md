Love this direction. Here’s a Lean-native rewrite of your “lenses as semantic embeddings” idea so it plugs cleanly into your nucleus-driven core, transport contracts, and ZK backends—without changing any verified semantics.

# 0) What must stay invariant (ground rules)

* **Truth lives in the core (Ω_R).** Every lens is just a representation that closes non-meet ops with its nucleus/interior (I), and you already have RT-1/RT-2 contracts for encode/decode + operators. Our “embedding” layer may *guide* compilation, but it can’t change semantics.  
* **One build contract.** Everything must compile with `lake build -- -Dno_sorry -DwarningAsError=true`.  
* **Lens discipline.** Any new analysis uses the existing tensor/graph/Clifford carriers (and later ZK backends) without introducing a new logic; they all reuse your “close by (I)” recipe.

# 1) Where this lives (lightweight file map)

```
lean/HeytingLean/
  Analysis/
    Embedding/
      Signature.lean         -- features extracted from φ and/or its Graph lens image
      GraphFingerprint.lean  -- fast Alexandroff/poset stats; no new axioms
      Spectrum.lean          -- combinatorial “spectrum” (depth/level histogram)
      Router.lean            -- rules → choose backend + hints; pure functions
  Crypto/
    ZK/Backend.lean          -- (from earlier) Backend + Laws (sound/complete)
    ZK/Export.lean           -- JSON emitters (R1CS/PLONK/AIR/BP)
  Exec/
    pct_advise.lean          -- prints recommendation & hints
    pct_prove.lean           -- add `--auto` to use Router
```

This keeps your **core** and **transports** intact. The “embedding” layer only *advises* which proved backend to use.

# 2) Topological “fingerprint” (Graph lens as fast embedding)

We reuse your Alexandroff/graph carrier (opens under a preorder) to get cheap structural cues. No new logic—just measurements over the existing encoding. 

```lean
-- Analysis/Embedding/Signature.lean
namespace HeytingLean.Analysis.Embedding

structure TopologicalSignature :=
  (vars             : Nat)
  (size             : Nat)      -- formula size
  (depth            : Nat)      -- max nesting
  (conj, disj, imp  : Nat)      -- counts
  (height, width    : Nat)      -- poset (Alexandroff) invariants
  (branchingMean    : Rat)
  (sccs             : Nat)      -- strongly connected components (preorder cycles)
  (symmetryHash     : UInt64)   -- crude automorphism hint (stable hash)
  (hasRangeChecks   : Bool)     -- detected numeric comparisons / intervals
  (repeatPatterns   : Nat)      -- repeated subform patterns

end HeytingLean.Analysis.Embedding
```

```lean
-- Analysis/Embedding/GraphFingerprint.lean
open HeytingLean.Analysis.Embedding

def fingerprintWithGraph (φ : Form) : TopologicalSignature := by
  -- 1) reuse Graph lens encoding you already have
  -- 2) compute poset height/width, branching stats, SCCs
  -- 3) inspect φ to count connectives and detect “range-check” macros
  -- (pure Lean; no new axioms)
  admit
```

> Why graph first? The Alexandroff transport is already in your plan and has clean RT-1/RT-2, so this analysis stays aligned with your verified representations. 

---

# 3) “Spectral” intuition without heavy algebra

Instead of real FFT/eigensolvers, define a **combinatorial spectrum**: histograms of node degrees/levels and depth-profile entropy—fully in Lean.

```lean
-- Analysis/Embedding/Spectrum.lean
structure CombSpectrum :=
  (levelHist : Array Nat)  -- histogram by poset level
  (entropy   : Rat)        -- normalized entropy of level distribution
  (peakiness : Nat)        -- # of prominent peaks

def spectrumOf (φ : Form) : CombSpectrum := by
  -- compute from Graph-lens levels / formula depth
  admit
```

Heuristic reading:

* **Peaky/high-entropy traces** → long uniform computations → consider **AIR/STARK**.
* **Low-frequency/simple** → **Boolean/R1CS** is fine.
* **Mixed but arithmetic-heavy** → **PLONK** (custom gates).
  These are routing hints; semantics remain the same. (Your Boolean/PLONK/AIR slots were outlined in the ZK multi-compiler note.)  

---

# 4) Router (advice, not authority)

The router converts signatures to a *proved* backend choice plus *compilation hints*. It never touches truth values—only picks which **Backend** (with `Laws`) to use. 

```lean
-- Analysis/Embedding/Router.lean
open HeytingLean.Analysis.Embedding
open HeytingLean.Crypto.ZK

inductive BackendChoice
| BooleanR1CS | PLONK | AIR | BulletRanges | Hybrid (parts : List BackendChoice)

structure Hints :=
  (rangeFields : List VarId := [])
  (loopiness  : Bool := false)
  (symmetry   : Bool := false)

def choose (sig : TopologicalSignature) (sp : CombSpectrum) : BackendChoice × Hints :=
  let arithy   := sig.disj + sig.imp > sig.conj ∧ sig.symmetryHash ≠ 0
  let loopLike := sp.peakiness ≥ 2 ∧ sig.sccs > 0
  let manyRanges := sig.hasRangeChecks
  if manyRanges then (.Hybrid [.BulletRanges, .BooleanR1CS], {rangeFields := [], loopiness := loopLike, symmetry := arithy})
  else if loopLike then (.AIR, {loopiness := true})
  else if arithy then (.PLONK, {symmetry := true})
  else (.BooleanR1CS, {})
```

* **Ranges → Bulletproof subcircuits**, arithmetic with symmetries → **PLONK**, long traces → **AIR**, else **R1CS**. (You already proposed these backends.)  

---

# 5) End-to-end flow (preserves your proofs)

```
φ in Ω_R
   │  compile (proved)
   ▼
Bool VM program  ── canonical run (proved) ──► Bool result
   │
   ├─► Router (advises backend + hints)   -- *analysis only*
   │
   └─► Backend.compile (R1CS / PLONK / AIR / Bullet)
        │             (each has Laws: sound & complete)
        ▼
   system + assignment / proof objects  ⇒  public output
   │
   └──(by Laws) decode(public) = evalΩ φ ρ
```

* The **only** new obligations are at the backend layer, where each backend already proves soundness/completeness against the canonical Bool run (your `Backend` + `Laws` pattern). The router merely *selects* which proved path to run. 

---

# 6) Minimal Lean stubs you can paste in

```lean
/-- Exec/pct_advise.lean --/
import HeytingLean.Analysis.Embedding.{Signature, GraphFingerprint, Spectrum, Router}

def pct_advise_main (φ : Form) : IO Unit := do
  let sig := fingerprintWithGraph φ
  let sp  := spectrumOf φ
  let (choice, hints) := choose sig sp
  -- print JSON with fields {choice, hints, sig, sp}
  pure ()

/-- Exec/pct_prove.lean (new flag) --/
def pct_prove_main (args) : IO UInt32 := do
  let φ := readForm args
  let ρ := readEnv args
  if args.auto then
    let sig := fingerprintWithGraph φ; let sp := spectrumOf φ
    let (choice, hints) := choose sig sp
    runBackend choice hints φ ρ         -- dispatches to proved Backend
  else
    runBackend args.backend {} φ ρ
```

> Dispatch targets are your existing/planned backends: **R1CS (Boolean lens)** today; **PLONK/AIR/Bulletproof** as you complete `Laws` for each.  

---

# 7) Pattern library (deterministic “vector search”)

Do this as pure Lean detectors, not ML: a table from simple shape predicates → backend preferences.

```lean
/-- Analysis/Embedding/Signature.lean --/
structure Pattern := (name : String) (pref : BackendChoice)

def library : List Pattern :=
  [⟨"simple_auth", .BooleanR1CS⟩,
   ⟨"range_check", .BulletRanges⟩,
   ⟨"recursive_verify", .AIR⟩]

def nearest (φ : Form) : Option Pattern :=
  -- match by syntactic features & subterm repetition (repeatPatterns)
  none
```

This mirrors your “semantic similarity” idea, but stays verifiable/reproducible in Lean (no stochastic embeddings).

---

# 8) Why this fits your architecture

* **Reuses your transports** (Graph/Tensor/Clifford) and round-trip contracts; we only *read* their encodings to compute signatures. 
* **Keeps a single semantic source of truth**—the Heyting core (Ω_R)—and your Boolean lens as the canonical ZK lowering; other backends prove equivalence via `Laws`. 
* **Matches the dimension dial narrative** (router can include the dial state as a feature if you want staged “classicalization” heuristics later). 

---

## “Done = green” checklist (drop into CI)

1. Build: `lake build -- -Dno_sorry -DwarningAsError=true` (no `sorry`, no `unsafe`). 
2. Lens invariants unchanged: existing RT-1/RT-2 tests pass. 
3. Router is **side-effect-free** and only influences backend selection.
4. For each backend you enable, import its `Laws` so `pct_prove --auto` still yields `decode(public)=evalΩ φ ρ`.

If you want, I can generate the actual `Signature.lean`, `GraphFingerprint.lean`, and `Router.lean` stubs (with a couple of real poset measurements) so they compile today and wire into `pct_advise`.
