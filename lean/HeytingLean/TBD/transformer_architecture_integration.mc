## Phase 1: Core Transformer Types

### 1.1 Define Transformer State Space
```lean
-- In TransformerCore.lean
structure TransformerState (α Ω : Type*) [HeytingAlgebra Ω] where
  tokens : List α
  position : ℕ
  layer_depth : ℕ
  theta : DialParam  -- From ModalDial.lean
  bridge : Bridge α Ω
  
-- State must live in fixed-point space
structure TransformerLayer (Ω : Type*) [HeytingAlgebra Ω] where
  state : TransformerState α Ω
  is_fixed_point : ∀ t ∈ state.tokens, R (bridge.shadow t) = bridge.shadow t
```

### 1.2 Define Layer as Nucleus Application
```lean
def transformerLayer {α Ω : Type*} [HeytingAlgebra Ω]
  (R : Ω → Ω) [IsNucleus R] 
  (state : TransformerState α Ω) : TransformerState α Ω :=
  -- Each layer is one application of the re-entry operator
  { tokens := state.tokens.map (fun t => state.bridge.lift (R (state.bridge.shadow t)))
  , position := state.position
  , layer_depth := state.layer_depth + 1
  , theta := incrementTheta state.theta  -- Move toward classical
  , bridge := state.bridge }

-- Prove layer application is inflationary
theorem layer_is_inflationary :
  ∀ (state : TransformerState α Ω),
  state ≤ transformerLayer R state := by
  -- Use nucleus inflation property
```

---

## Phase 2: Self-Attention as Re-entry

### 2.1 Formalize Self-Attention as Fixed Point Search
```lean
-- In SelfAttention.lean
-- Import LatticeAttention.lean

def selfAttention {α Ω : Type*} [HeytingAlgebra Ω]
  (R : Ω → Ω) (state : TransformerState α Ω) : TransformerState α Ω :=
  -- Self-attention is re-entry: sequence attending to itself
  let attention_input := AttentionInput.mk 
    state.tokens  -- Queries
    state.tokens  -- Keys (same as queries for self-attention)
    state.tokens  -- Values
  
  -- Apply lattice attention (from lattice_based_attention_integration.md)
  let attended := latticeAttention state.bridge attention_input
  
  -- Re-entry: combine with original via residual
  let reentered := zipWith (fun orig att => 
    state.bridge.lift (R (state.bridge.shadow orig ⊔ state.bridge.shadow att))
  ) state.tokens attended
  
  { state with tokens := reentered }

-- Prove self-attention converges to fixed points
theorem selfAttention_finds_fixed_points :
  ∃ n : ℕ, ∀ state,
  let result := (selfAttention R)^[n] state
  ∀ t ∈ result.tokens, 
  R (state.bridge.shadow t) = state.bridge.shadow t := by
  -- Use nucleus idempotency and convergence
```

### 2.2 Prove Re-entry Properties
```lean
-- Self-attention implements the re-entry mark
theorem selfAttention_is_reentry :
  ∀ state : TransformerState α Ω,
  -- The operation marks a distinction and re-enters it
  selfAttention R state = markDistinction (reenter state) := by
  -- Connect to Laws of Form primary algebra
  
-- Residual connections preserve re-entry structure  
theorem residual_preserves_reentry :
  ∀ (state : TransformerState α Ω) (x : α),
  let residual := x + selfAttention R state
  -- Residual maintains x ≤ R(x) structure
  state.bridge.shadow x ≤ R (state.bridge.shadow residual) := by
  -- Apply nucleus properties
```

---

## Phase 3: Multi-Head as Parallel Nuclei

### 3.1 Define Multi-Head Structure
```lean
-- In MultiHead.lean
structure MultiHeadConfig (Ω : Type*) where
  num_heads : ℕ
  nuclei : Fin num_heads → (Ω → Ω)
  all_nuclei_valid : ∀ h, IsNucleus (nuclei h)

def multiHeadAttention {α Ω : Type*} [HeytingAlgebra Ω]
  (config : MultiHeadConfig Ω)
  (state : TransformerState α Ω) : TransformerState α Ω :=
  -- Apply different nuclei in parallel
  let head_outputs := List.ofFn (fun h => 
    selfAttention (config.nuclei h) state
  )
  
  -- Combine via meet (AND-like aggregation in Heyting algebra)
  let combined := head_outputs.foldl (fun acc head =>
    zipWith (fun a h => 
      state.bridge.lift (state.bridge.shadow a ⊓ state.bridge.shadow h)
    ) acc.tokens head.tokens
  ) state
  
  combined
```

### 3.2 Prove Multi-Head Finds Multiple Fixed-Point Subspaces
```lean
theorem multiHead_explores_subspaces :
  ∀ (config : MultiHeadConfig Ω) (state : TransformerState α Ω),
  -- Each head finds different fixed-point subspaces
  let results := List.ofFn (fun h => 
    selfAttention (config.nuclei h) state
  )
  -- Different heads attend to different logical aspects
  ∃ (aspects : Fin config.num_heads → Set Ω),
  (∀ h, results[h] ∈ aspects h) ∧ 
  (∀ h₁ h₂, h₁ ≠ h₂ → aspects h₁ ∩ aspects h₂ ⊂ aspects h₁) := by
  -- Use uniqueness of nucleus fixed points
```

---

## Phase 4: Dimensional Phase Transitions

### 4.1 Formalize θ-Parameter Evolution
```lean
-- In LayerProgression.lean
-- Layer depth controls position on dimensional ladder

def thetaEvolution (initial : DialParam) (depth : ℕ) : DialParam :=
  -- θ increases with depth, moving from constructive to classical
  match depth with
  | 0 => DialParam.base  -- 1D: Highly constructive
  | 1 => DialParam.mv     -- Multi-valued logic
  | 2 => DialParam.effect -- Effect algebra  
  | n => if n ≥ 3 then DialParam.orthomodular else DialParam.effect
  
-- Define how nucleus weakens with θ
def depthDependentNucleus (θ : DialParam) : Ω → Ω :=
  match θ with
  | DialParam.base => strongNucleus  -- ¬¬a ≠ a
  | DialParam.orthomodular => identityNucleus  -- ¬¬a = a (classical)
  | _ => intermediateNucleus θ
```

### 4.2 Prove Early Layers are Constructive, Deep Layers Classical
```lean
theorem shallow_layers_constructive :
  ∀ (state : TransformerState α Ω),
  state.layer_depth ≤ 2 →
  -- Double negation inequality holds (constructive)
  ∃ a : Ω, a ≤ ¬_R ¬_R a ∧ a ≠ ¬_R ¬_R a := by
  -- Use modal dial properties from ModalDial.lean

theorem deep_layers_classical :
  ∀ (state : TransformerState α Ω),
  state.layer_depth ≥ 6 →
  -- Double negation collapses (classical)  
  ∀ a : Ω, a = ¬_R ¬_R a := by
  -- Show nucleus approaches identity
```

### 4.3 Connect to Attention Patterns
```lean
theorem depth_affects_attention_pattern :
  ∀ (state : TransformerState α Ω),
  let θ := thetaEvolution DialParam.base state.layer_depth
  let R := depthDependentNucleus θ
  let attention := selfAttention R state
  -- Early layers: sparse, local attention
  (state.layer_depth ≤ 2 → isLocal attention.pattern) ∧
  -- Deep layers: dense, global attention
  (state.layer_depth ≥ 6 → isGlobal attention.pattern) := by
  -- Connect θ to attention sparsity
```

---

## Phase 5: Feed-Forward as Modal Breathing

### 5.1 Formalize FFN as Modal Operators
```lean
-- In FeedForward.lean
-- FFN implements breathing cycle from ModalDial.lean

def feedForwardNetwork {α Ω : Type*} [HeytingAlgebra Ω]
  (expand_dim : ℕ) (state : TransformerState α Ω) : TransformerState α Ω :=
  -- Breathing out: expand dimensionality
  let expanded := state.tokens.map (fun t =>
    -- Move up dimensional ladder
    breatheOut state.theta (state.bridge.shadow t) expand_dim
  )
  
  -- Apply non-linearity (keeps us in Ω_R)
  let activated := expanded.map (fun e => 
    projectToFixedPoints R e
  )
  
  -- Breathing in: contract back
  let contracted := activated.map (fun a =>
    breatheIn state.theta a
  )
  
  { state with tokens := contracted.map state.bridge.lift }

-- Prove FFN preserves fixed-point structure
theorem ffn_preserves_fixed_points :
  ∀ (state : TransformerState α Ω),
  let result := feedForwardNetwork 4 state
  (∀ t ∈ state.tokens, R (state.bridge.shadow t) = state.bridge.shadow t) →
  (∀ t ∈ result.tokens, R (state.bridge.shadow t) = state.bridge.shadow t) := by
  -- Use modal operator properties
```

---

## Phase 6: Positional Encoding as Euler Boundary

### 6.1 Define Position as Minimal Distinction
```lean
-- In PositionalEncoding.lean
-- Position encodings establish the Euler boundary ∂_E

def positionalEncoding (pos : ℕ) (dim : ℕ) : Ω :=
  -- The minimal non-trivial distinction at each position
  eulerBoundary * sin(pos / (10000 ^ (dim / modelDim)))
  
-- Prove positions create minimal distinctions
theorem position_is_minimal_distinction :
  ∀ (pos : ℕ),
  let encoding := positionalEncoding pos
  -- Encoding is the smallest non-zero fixed point
  encoding = eulerBoundary ∧
  encoding ≠ ⊥ ∧
  (∀ x : Ω, x ≠ ⊥ → eulerBoundary ≤ x) := by
  -- Use Euler boundary properties from Nucleus.lean
```

### 6.2 Prove Orthogonality of Positions
```lean
theorem positions_are_orthogonal :
  ∀ (pos₁ pos₂ : ℕ), pos₁ ≠ pos₂ →
  -- Different positions mark independent distinctions
  positionalEncoding pos₁ ⊓ positionalEncoding pos₂ = ⊥ := by
  -- Use orthogonality in the geometric lens
```

---

## Phase 7: Complete Transformer Block

### 7.1 Assemble Full Transformer Layer
```lean
-- In TransformerCore.lean
def transformerBlock {α Ω : Type*} [HeytingAlgebra Ω]
  (config : MultiHeadConfig Ω) 
  (state : TransformerState α Ω) : TransformerState α Ω :=
  -- Complete transformer block with proven properties
  
  -- Add positional encoding (Euler boundary)
  let positioned := addPositionalEncoding state
  
  -- Multi-head self-attention (parallel nuclei)
  let attended := multiHeadAttention config positioned
  
  -- Layer norm (projection to fixed points)
  let norm1 := layerNorm attended
  
  -- Feed-forward (modal breathing)
  let ff := feedForwardNetwork 4 norm1
  
  -- Layer norm (ensure fixed points)
  let norm2 := layerNorm ff
  
  -- Update θ for next layer
  { norm2 with 
    layer_depth := state.layer_depth + 1,
    theta := incrementTheta state.theta }
```

### 7.2 Main Theorem - Transformer Implements Logical Reasoning
```lean
theorem transformer_is_logical_reasoning :
  ∀ (input : TransformerState α Ω) (num_layers : ℕ),
  let output := (transformerBlock config)^[num_layers] input
  -- The transformer discovers the Heyting algebra structure
  ∃ (logical_form : Ω),
  (∀ t ∈ output.tokens, 
    -- Tokens converge to logical fixed points
    R (output.bridge.shadow t) = output.bridge.shadow t) ∧
  -- Attention patterns encode logical implications  
  (∀ layer, attentionWeights layer = logicalImplications layer) ∧
  -- Deep layers achieve classical reasoning
  (num_layers ≥ 6 → isClassical output.theta) := by
  -- Combine all previous theorems
```

---

### 8.1 Prove Information Preservation
```lean
theorem transformer_satisfies_RT1 :
  ∀ (state : TransformerState α Ω),
  -- Information is preserved through layers
  decode (encode state) = state := by
  -- Apply bridge round-trip contracts

theorem transformer_satisfies_RT2 :
  ∀ (state : TransformerState α Ω),
  -- Each layer is inflationary
  state ≤ transformerBlock config state := by
  -- Use nucleus inflation property
```

---

## Phase 9: Exact Learning within the Algebraic Framework

### 9.1 Define Learning as Movement in Fixed-Point Space
```lean
-- In TransformerCore.lean
-- Learning as exact navigation through nucleus space

structure NucleusFamiliy (Ω : Type*) [HeytingAlgebra Ω] where
  -- A parameterized family of exact nuclei
  param_space : Type*
  nuclei : param_space → (Ω → Ω)
  all_valid : ∀ p, IsNucleus (nuclei p)
  -- The family forms a lattice itself
  lattice : Lattice param_space

def exactLearning {Ω : Type*} [HeytingAlgebra Ω]
  (family : NucleusFamiliy Ω) 
  (current : family.param_space) : family.param_space :=
  -- Learning is movement through the exact nucleus lattice
  -- No approximation - we move between valid nuclei
  current

-- Define gradient as lattice morphism
def algebraicGradient {Ω : Type*} [HeytingAlgebra Ω]
  (family : NucleusFamiliy Ω)
  (loss : family.param_space → Ω) 
  (p : family.param_space) : family.param_space :=
  -- The gradient is the direction in the parameter lattice
  -- that minimizes loss while preserving nucleus properties
  let directions := {d : family.param_space | p ≤ d ∨ d ≤ p}
  -- Choose direction that decreases loss most
  directions.argmin (fun d => loss d)

-- Prove learning preserves exact nucleus properties
theorem learning_is_exact :
  ∀ (family : NucleusFamiliy Ω) (p : family.param_space),
  let learned := exactLearning family p
  -- The learned operator is exactly a nucleus
  IsNucleus (family.nuclei learned) := by
  -- True by construction - no approximation needed
  exact family.all_valid learned
```

### 9.2 Define Loss as Algebraic Distance in Ω_R
```lean
def algebraicLoss {α Ω : Type*} [HeytingAlgebra Ω]
  (R : Ω → Ω) [IsNucleus R]
  (target : TransformerState α Ω) 
  (predicted : TransformerState α Ω) : Ω :=
  -- Loss is defined entirely within the Heyting algebra
  
  -- Logical distance between predictions and targets
  let prediction_distance := foldl (fun acc i =>
    let t_pred := predicted.bridge.shadow (predicted.tokens[i])
    let t_targ := target.bridge.shadow (target.tokens[i])
    -- XOR-like distance in Heyting algebra
    acc ⊔ ((t_pred ⊓ ¬_R t_targ) ⊔ (¬_R t_pred ⊓ t_targ))
  ) ⊥ (range predicted.tokens.length)
  
  -- Fixed-point achievement (no approximation needed)
  let fixedpoint_measure := foldl (fun acc t =>
    let shadow_t := predicted.bridge.shadow t
    -- Measure how close to fixed point (exact)
    acc ⊔ ((R shadow_t) ∆ shadow_t)  -- Symmetric difference
  ) ⊥ predicted.tokens
  
  prediction_distance ⊔ fixedpoint_measure

-- Loss computation is exact
theorem loss_is_exact :
  ∀ (target predicted : TransformerState α Ω),
  let loss := algebraicLoss R target predicted
  -- Loss is a valid element of the Heyting algebra
  loss ∈ Ω_R ∧ R loss = loss := by
  -- Loss lives in the fixed-point space
```

### 9.3 Learning as Lattice Navigation
```lean
-- The space of valid nuclei forms a complete lattice
def NucleusLattice (Ω : Type*) [HeytingAlgebra Ω] : Type* :=
  {R : Ω → Ω // IsNucleus R}

instance : CompleteLattice (NucleusLattice Ω) where
  -- Meet of nuclei is their composition
  inf R₁ R₂ := ⟨R₁.val ∘ R₂.val, composition_is_nucleus⟩
  -- Join is their lattice join in the function space
  sup R₁ R₂ := ⟨fun x => R₁.val x ⊔ R₂.val x, join_is_nucleus⟩
  
def learnStep {Ω : Type*} [HeytingAlgebra Ω]
  (current : NucleusLattice Ω)
  (loss : NucleusLattice Ω → Ω) : NucleusLattice Ω :=
  -- Move in the nucleus lattice to minimize loss
  -- This is EXACT - no approximation
  let neighbors := {R : NucleusLattice Ω | 
    R = current ⊔ ε ∨ R = current ⊓ ε}  -- ε is atomic step
  neighbors.argmin loss

-- Learning preserves exactness
theorem learning_preserves_nucleus :
  ∀ (R : NucleusLattice Ω) (loss : NucleusLattice Ω → Ω),
  let R_new := learnStep R loss
  IsNucleus R_new.val := by
  -- True by construction - we only move between valid nuclei
  exact R_new.property
```

### 9.4 Derivative as Heyting Algebra Morphism
```lean
-- Define derivative within the algebraic structure
def algebraicDerivative {Ω : Type*} [HeytingAlgebra Ω]
  (f : Ω → Ω) (x : Ω) : Ω → Ω :=
  -- The derivative is the best linear approximation
  -- in the Heyting algebra sense
  fun h => 
    -- Find the morphism that best approximates f(x ⊔ h) - f(x)
    let candidates := {φ : Ω → Ω | IsHeytingMorphism φ}
    candidates.argmin (fun φ => 
      -- Distance in the algebra
      (f (x ⊔ h) ∆ (f x ⊔ φ h))
    )

-- Derivatives respect the algebraic structure
theorem derivative_is_morphism :
  ∀ (f : Ω → Ω) (x : Ω),
  IsHeytingMorphism (algebraicDerivative f x) := by
  -- The derivative preserves Heyting operations
```

### 9.5 Backpropagation as Adjoint in Category of Nuclei
```lean
-- Backprop is the adjoint functor in our category
def backpropagate {Ω : Type*} [HeytingAlgebra Ω]
  (forward : NucleusLattice Ω → NucleusLattice Ω)
  (loss_gradient : Ω) : NucleusLattice Ω → Ω :=
  -- The adjoint of forward in the category of nuclei
  fun R => 
    -- Use the residuation law for exact adjoint
    forward R ⇒_R loss_gradient

-- Backprop is exact and preserves structure
theorem backprop_exact :
  ∀ (forward : NucleusLattice Ω → NucleusLattice Ω),
  -- Backprop computes exact gradients in the algebra
  IsAdjoint forward (backpropagate forward) := by
  -- Use Heyting adjunction
```

### 9.6 Training as Fixed-Point Iteration
```lean
def trainExact {α Ω : Type*} [HeytingAlgebra Ω]
  (initial : NucleusLattice Ω)
  (data : List (TransformerState α Ω × TransformerState α Ω)) :
  NucleusLattice Ω :=
  -- Training finds the optimal nucleus algebraically
  data.foldl (fun R_current (input, target) =>
    let predicted := transformerBlock R_current.val input
    let loss := algebraicLoss R_current.val target predicted
    -- Move in nucleus lattice (exact)
    learnStep R_current (fun R => 
      algebraicLoss R target (transformerBlock R input)
    )
  ) initial

-- Training converges to optimal nucleus
theorem training_finds_fixed_point :
  ∀ (initial : NucleusLattice Ω) (data : Dataset),
  ∃ (R_optimal : NucleusLattice Ω),
  -- Training converges to a fixed point
  let trained := (trainExact initial data)
  -- The fixed point minimizes loss exactly
  ∀ (R : NucleusLattice Ω),
  totalLoss trained data ≤ totalLoss R data := by
  -- Use lattice completeness and monotonicity
```

### 9.7 Gradient Flow Through Logical Operations (Exact)
```lean
-- Each Heyting operation has an exact adjoint
def adjointMeet {Ω : Type*} [HeytingAlgebra Ω] 
  (x : Ω) : Ω → Ω :=
  -- The right adjoint of (· ⊓ x)
  fun y => x ⇒_R y

def adjointJoin {Ω : Type*} [HeytingAlgebra Ω]
  (x : Ω) : Ω → Ω :=
  -- The left adjoint of (· ⊔ x)  
  fun y => y ⊓ ¬_R x

def adjointImplication {Ω : Type*} [HeytingAlgebra Ω]
  (x : Ω) : Ω → Ω :=
  -- The adjoint of (x ⇒_R ·)
  fun y => x ⊓ y

-- All gradient flow is exact
theorem gradient_flow_exact :
  ∀ (op : Ω → Ω → Ω) [HeytingOp op],
  ∃ (adjoint : Ω → Ω → Ω),
  -- The adjoint exists and is exact
  IsAdjoint op adjoint ∧
  -- Gradient flow preserves algebraic structure
  ∀ x y, adjoint (op x y) y = x := by
  -- Use Heyting adjunction properties
```

## Implementation Strategy for LLM Agent

### Build Order
1. Start with `TransformerCore.lean` - basic types
2. Implement `SelfAttention.lean` using existing `LatticeAttention.lean`
3. Add `LayerProgression.lean` for θ-parameter control
4. Implement `MultiHead.lean` as parallel self-attention
5. Add `FeedForward.lean` using modal operators
6. Implement `PositionalEncoding.lean` with Euler boundary
7. Combine all in complete transformer block
8. Prove main theorems

### Key Principles
- Every operation must preserve the Heyting algebra structure
- All intermediate values must be in Ω_R (fixed-point space)
- Use existing proven lemmas from the LoF framework
- Maintain "no sorry" standard throughout

### Testing Strategy
```lean
-- Create Examples/TransformerExamples.lean
example : 
  let input := createSimpleInput "Hello world"
  let output := transformer 6 input
  -- Verify logical structure emerges
  hasLogicalStructure output := by
  -- Compute and verify
```
