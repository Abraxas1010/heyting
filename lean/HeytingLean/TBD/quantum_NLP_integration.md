Awesome — here’s a concrete, **QNLP ↔ Re-entry/Heyting** integration plan that you can drop into your stack. I stick to mathematically safe claims, line them up with your nuclei/bridges, and show exactly where QNLP (lambeq/DisCoCat/ZX) fits. Key references are cited inline.

---

# Executive summary

* **What QNLP gives you.** A categorical pipeline (DisCoCat) from **grammar** (pregroups/CCG) to **compositional semantics** as **quantum circuits**; lambeq compiles sentences to parameterized circuits you can train on simulators or QPUs. ([arXiv][1])
* **What you already have.** A **Heyting core** ( \Omega_R ) from your nucleus (R), residuation (a\wedge_R b\le c \iff b\le a\Rightarrow_R c), algebraic attention, and bridges (Tensor/Graph/Projector) with RT contracts.
* **How we fuse them.** Build a **Quantum→Heyting bridge**: map each QNLP circuit to **effects/states** (POVMs/density matrices), then **interiorize** via a **quantum nucleus** (J_q) (decoherence/commuting–fragment projection) so the image lands in a **Heyting subalgebra**; use the resulting objects as **queries/keys/values** for **Heyting attention** and as **valuations** (v) (e.g., expectations (\mathrm{Tr}(\rho E))).
* **Training.** Keep your **algebraic backprop** (residuation) for the symbolic/Heyting side; train **lambeq circuits** with parameter-shift or classical optimizers. If you want all-algebraic learning, you can drive circuits by **constraint-to-valuation** updates while preserving Heyting laws on the classical side.

# Background (what we rely on)

* **DisCoCat.** Grammar derivations (pregroup or CCG) compose via **compact/rigid monoidal** structure; a strong monoidal functor sends grammar diagrams to linear maps/tensors. QNLP uses the same categorical machinery to **compile to quantum circuits** (cups/caps → wire contractions). ([Wikipedia][2])
* **lambeq.** Open-source toolkit that parses text, builds DisCoCat diagrams, and **converts them to quantum circuits** (PennyLane/Cirq/Qiskit backends), with tutorials and training utilities. ([docs.quantinuum.com][3])
* **Foundations for near-term QNLP.** The canonical blueprint connecting diagrams and circuits and leveraging ZX-calculus for circuit simplification. ([arXiv][1])
* **ZX calculus.** Sound and complete graphical rewrite system for quantum circuits (we’ll treat it as a **rewrite nucleus** on circuits before semantics). ([Department of Computer Science Oxford][4])
* **Feasibility.** There are early sentiment and classification demos (hybrid simulations and small devices) using lambeq; these establish the end-to-end toolchain. ([arXiv][5])

# Integration blueprint

## A) New directories & modules

```
lean/
  QuantumNLP/
    Grammar.lean            -- (optional) typed categories for pregroup/CCG stubs
    ZXRewrite.lean          -- abstract rewrite nucleus on circuits (interface)
    QSemantics.lean         -- states, effects, CPTP; quantum nucleus J_q
    QNLPBridge.lean         -- Bridge from circuits/effects to Ω_R (Heyting)
    Valuation.lean          -- v : Ω_R → [0,1] realized from quantum expectations
  Applications/
    LatticeAttention.lean   -- (already drafted) Heyting attention
    QNLPAttention.lean      -- glue: lambeq outputs → Ω_R inputs to attention

    QNLPCompliance.lean     -- round-trip, residuation, and example sentences
```

(Your existing `Quantum/` and `Bridges/` modules cover most of the low-level semantics; we’ll reference them.)

---

## B) Categories & functors (high level)

Let ( \mathcal{G} ) be the grammar category (pregroup or **CCG as a biclosed/rigid category**) and ( \mathcal{Q} ) the **quantum process** category (finite-dim Hilbert spaces / CPTP maps). DisCoCat provides a strong monoidal functor
[
\mathsf{Discocat} : \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{Q},
]
which lambeq implements as “parse → string diagram → quantum circuit”. ([ACL Anthology][6])

We do **not** formalize (\mathcal{G}) fully in Lean now; we only need:

* a **typed parse** per sentence (object in (\mathcal{G})),
* its compiled **circuit** (C\in \mathcal{Q}).

---

## C) Quantum → Heyting bridge

### C.1 Quantum nucleus (J_q) (effect/OML → Heyting)

* **Carrier**: effects (E) with (0\le E\le I), states (\rho) (density matrices).
* **Nucleus** (J_q): interior/projection to a **commuting fragment** (or a **pinching** in a chosen measurement basis), e.g.
  [
  J_q(A)=\text{Proj}\big(\int U A U^\dagger ,d\mu(U)\big),
  ]
  as in your projector nucleus. Fixed points (\Omega_{J_q}) form a **Heyting subalgebra** (complements/meets exact; joins interiorized), letting you reuse your (\Rightarrow_R). (This is the same construction you already use for the projector lens.)
  *Why:* quantum logic is orthomodular, not Heyting; **interiorization** to a commuting subalgebra restores a Heyting structure for our operators. (ZX can be used to **normalize** circuits before measurement.) ([arXiv][1])

### C.2 Bridge `QNLPBridge : Bridge Circuit Ω_R`

Define:

* `shadow : Circuit ↦ Ω_R` by

  1. compile circuit (C) to an **effect** (E_C) (or a POVM component) and optionally a state (\rho) (from prior context),
  2. interiorize to `J_q(E_C)` and **encode** as an element of (\Omega_R) via your **Projector/Effect lens**,
* `lift : Ω_R ↦ Circuit` picks a canonical representative (e.g., a diagonal projector circuit or a tag object) so `RT-1` holds.

**RT contracts.**

* `shadow (lift u) = u` (exact),
* `lift (shadow C) ≤ C` as an **interpretation inequality** (lax), sufficient for all our transport lemmas.

(You already proved shadow-commutation for complement/meet and **lax join**; reuse those.)

### C.3 Valuations from quantum expectations

Define **valuations** ( v : \Omega_R \to [0,1] ) by:

* (v([E]) := \mathrm{Tr}(\rho,E)) if a sentence context produces ( \rho ) and an “observable meaning” effect (E),
* or a **frequency/empirical** estimate on simulated datasets.

This aligns with lambeq practice (expectations/probabilities from circuits) and gives the **scores** for Heyting attention. ([docs.quantinuum.com][3])

---

## D) Attention and composition

* **Queries/keys/values** for attention are **Heyting elements** produced by `QNLPBridge.shadow` applied to circuits from (sub)phrases (or previous layer’s outputs).
* **Weights** are **implications** (k\Rightarrow_R q); **aggregation** is join of meets (your `headΩ`) — completely law-abiding.
* **ZX rewrite nucleus**: Before evaluation, rewrite circuits using ZX rules to a **normal form** and then apply (J_q); this keeps the pipeline canonical and hardware-agnostic. ([Department of Computer Science Oxford][4])

---

## E) Training strategy

### E.1 Two-loop (hybrid) training

1. **Algebraic loop (exact).**
   Update the **classical/Heyting parameters** (mask choices, thresholds, rule sets) by **monotone closure** (h_{t+1}=\mathrm{Close}_B(h_t)) (Knaster–Tarski/Kleene). Proven convergence under your existing conditions.
2. **Quantum loop (variational).**
   Optimize lambeq circuit parameters with the **parameter-shift** rule or classical optimizers, *using the algebraic head’s valuation targets as signals* (e.g., constrain (v([E])) to satisfy order relations).

You retain **exactness** on the reasoning side while exploiting quantum circuits for compositional embeddings. (This mirrors current QNLP practice while adding your guarantees on attention & inference.) ([docs.quantinuum.com][3])

### E.2 Fully algebraic option (when needed)

If you want to avoid real-valued optimization entirely: keep circuit parameters fixed to a **discrete family** and drive selection via **Occam/PSR/Dialectic** (your fixed-point learning). Performance may be lower; verifiability is maximal.

---

## F) Proof obligations (Lean)

1. **Quantum nucleus**: `is_nucleus J_q` on the effect carrier (inflationary, idempotent, meet-preserving on the commuting fragment).
2. **Bridge**: `QNLPBridge.shadow ∘ QNLPBridge.lift = id` (RT-1) and `lift ∘ shadow ≤ id` (RT-2).
3. **Transport**: reuse your lemmas so `shadow (stageOrthocomplement x) = compl (shadow x)` and joins are preserved **laxly**.
4. **Valuation monotonicity**: (E\le F \Rightarrow \mathrm{Tr}(\rho E) \le \mathrm{Tr}(\rho F)).
5. **Attention soundness**: your `headΩ` lemmas (monotone; meet-preserving under `[Frame Ω]`) apply; pairwise residuation holds by Heyting adjunction.

---

## G) Pipeline (end-to-end)

1. **Parsing & circuits** (Python): lambeq parses text, builds DisCoCat diagrams, compiles to PQCs; optionally ZX-simplify. ([docs.quantinuum.com][3])
2. **Quantization to effects**: pick an **observable** family (classification POVM, entailment effects, etc.); from circuits + context state produce (E,\rho).
3. **Interiorization**: apply (J_q) to land in (\Omega_{J_q}); map via projector lens to elements of (\Omega_R).
4. **Attention**: run **Heyting attention** (`headΩ`) with valuations (v(E)=\mathrm{Tr}(\rho E)).
5. **Training**: (i) algebraic updates for Heyting parameters; (ii) lambeq variational updates using targets induced by your order/constraints.
6. **Round-trip**: verify RT contracts on samples (shadow-lift equalities/inequalities).

---

## H) Concrete tasks to land this

### H.1 Minimal lambeq adapter (Python side)

* Export, per sentence, **(circuit json, observable spec)** per token & phrase.
* Compute **(\rho)** and **(E)** (or compile to **Kraus/POVM** objects) and dump to your Lean pipeline as matrices (for small finite models) or as symbolic handles if you keep them abstract.

Docs & examples are in Quantinuum’s site and repo. ([docs.quantinuum.com][3])

### H.2 Lean stubs

* `QuantumNLP/QSemantics.lean`: types `Density`, `Effect`, `isNucleus J_q`, `valuation : Ω_R → ℝ`.
* `QuantumNLP/QNLPBridge.lean`: `structure QNLPBridge (α Ω) extends Bridge α Ω` plus proofs of RT.
* `Applications/QNLPAttention.lean`: sugar to feed `head (QNLPBridge …)` from exported lambeq artifacts.
* `Tests/QNLPCompliance.lean`: tiny toy sentence (Boolean Ω or finite opens), assert pairwise residuation and attention monotonicity; add one canned example from lambeq sentiment demos. ([arXiv][5])

---

## I) Lenses mapping (your “four lenses”)

* **Tensor lens**: use density/effect matrices as tensors; `Int` = projector/pinching; attention runs with your MV/effect stage if you want graded mixing.
* **Graph lens**: build a **grammar/derivation graph**; opens in Alexandroff topology represent reachable phrase meanings; valuation = normalized reachability or compiled quantum expectations. ([Wikipedia][2])
* **Geometric/Projector lens**: direct—effects/projectors fit; (J_q) is the projector nucleus; joins via interiorization; complements/meet exact.

---

## J) Risks & mitigations

* **Heyting vs orthomodular.** We avoid logical mismatch by **interiorization** to a commuting fragment via (J_q) before entering (\Omega_R).
* **Circuit size (ZX extraction hardness).** ZX simplification can be #P-hard in worst cases; we use it opportunistically with bounded rewrite passes. ([DROPS][7])
* **Quantum advantage.** Current evidence is exploratory; we keep a **hybrid** stack with proofs on the logic side and pragmatic training on the circuit side. ([arXiv][8])

---

## K) Milestones & CI gates

* **M1**: `J_q` nucleus & `QNLPBridge` compile; `headΩ` + residuation tests green.
* **M2**: lambeq adapter exports small circuits; valuations flow into Lean (toy datasets); ZX optional.
* **M3**: two-loop training demo (algebraic constraints + variational PQCs) on a 2–3 class task (sentiment/entailment). ([arXiv][5])
* **M4**: lens integrations exercised; round-trip contracts verified on Tensor/Projector; report perf vs. pure classical Heyting attention.

---

## L) What to claim (and what not)

* ✅ **Claim**: a **sound** pipeline where **attention and reasoning** stay **Heyting-exact**, and **QNLP circuits** supply compositional embeddings/valuations.
* ✅ **Claim**: fixed-point convergence for **algebraic training** on your parameter lattice; standard convergence for the variational quantum loop.
* ❌ **Don’t claim**: softmax attention = implication; or that QNLP already gives scalable quantum advantage (still an open area). ([arXiv][8])

If you want, I can now draft the **Lean stubs** for `QNLPBridge.lean` (with RT proofs), `QSemantics.lean` (`J_q`, effects/states, valuation lemmas), and a **tiny end-to-end example** that consumes one lambeq-exported circuit and runs it through **Heyting attention**.
