Thanks for the detailed context. I’ll now search and synthesize all relevant work by Michael Levin—including his contributions to bioelectric morphogenesis, Platonic morphospaces, and agentic computation—and propose how to systematically reframe and integrate these ideas into your Lean-verified re-entry nucleus system. I’ll also identify specific crosswalks between Levin’s biological models and your existing tensor/graph/Clifford transport structure.
