Here’s a tight review + a concrete, formal mapping of **Quantum Active Inference (QAI)** into your re-entry/nucleus framework, staying as close as possible to your primitives (J, \Omega_J, \theta) and the staged lenses (Heyting → MV → effect → orthomodular).

# 1) Quick review of what you’ve built (why this is ready for QAI)

* The **guiding principle** is already perfect for QAI: treat re-entry as an **interior/nucleus** and phrase everything else as structure transported along that nucleus (and reuse mathlib classes) .
* Your **stage transport** and bridges already name the right quantum carriers (MV/effect/orthomodular; tensor/graph/Clifford) and commuting lemmas with `logicalShadow`—exactly the slots we’ll use for POVMs, projectors and CP maps .
* The repo plan already anticipates **`Quantum/Orthomodular.lean`** and **`Quantum/ProjectorNucleus.lean`**, so we’ll add **`Quantum/ActiveInference.lean`** right there .
* You’ve queued the **Occam/PSR/Dialectic from just (J, \theta)**; that’s the exact lever we’ll pull for the QAI laws and tests .

# 2) Minimal mapping: “Quantum Active Inference” by your primitives

**Carriers & updates (all standard QIT):**

* **Quantum states**: density operators (\rho) on ( \mathcal H ).
* **Observations**: **POVM/effect algebra** elements (E) ((0\le E\le I)), giving (p(o)=\mathrm{Tr}(\rho E_o)). Effects form an **effect algebra** and generalise events for unsharp/quantum measurements. ([Wikipedia][1])
* **Updates**: **quantum instruments** ( {\mathcal I_o}_o ) (each ( \mathcal I_o) CP, (\sum_o \mathcal I_o) CPTP) capture “observe (o) & evolve” in one step. ([Wikipedia][2])
* **Quantum Bayes**: Petz recovery formalises a quantum Bayes rule—useful for retrodictive/diagnostic steps. ([Wikipedia][3])

**One-step AIF dynamic (policy-conditioned):**
Fix a policy (\pi) (choice of instrument/action). Define the **policy step** on states
[
F_\pi(\rho) ;:=; \sum_{o} \mathcal I_{o}^{(\pi)}(\rho)\quad\text{(CPTP)}.
]

**Make it your (J): a *safety/viability interior* on sets of states**
For (U\subseteq \mathrm{Dens}(\mathcal H)),
[
J_{\text{QAI}}(U) ;:=; {\rho\in U \mid \forall \pi,, \forall o,; \mathcal I^{(\pi)}_{o}(\rho)\in U}.
]
This is **deflationary**, **monotone**, **idempotent**—hence a **nucleus** (largest subset of (U) forward-invariant under every admissible “observe-and-act” step). That drops straight into your LoF/Nucleus story and stage transport.

**Dial (\theta) & birth:** your existing **first-stabilisation index** ( \mathrm{birth}_J(U) ) remains the “least number of AIF breaths to invariance” for any specification (U). This is exactly how you already use (\theta) .

# 3) Occam, PSR, Dialectic (quantum versions, unchanged definitions)

You can keep your exact laws (now over sets of density operators):

* **Occam (minimal stage that suffices)**:
  (J_{\text{occam}}(P) := \bigcup{,U\subseteq P \mid U\in\Omega_{J_{\text{QAI}}}\ \wedge\ \mathrm{birth}(U)\text{ minimal},}). Same interior proof pattern as before. 
* **PSR (sufficiency = invariance)**: ( \mathrm{PSR}*{J*{\text{QAI}}}(P)\iff J_{\text{QAI}}(P)=P). Stability along instrument-reachability is proved exactly as in your set-theoretic PSR note. 
* **Dialectic (synthesis = join via closure)**: ( \mathrm{synth}(T,A)=J_{\text{QAI}}(T\cup A)) with the same universal property inside ( \Omega_{J_{\text{QAI}}}). 

# 4) Expected Free Energy in the quantum stage (risk/ambiguity ↔ epistemic/extrinsic)

Active Inference evaluates policies by **Expected Free Energy (EFE)**. In classical AIF:

* **risk + ambiguity** or **expected value + information gain** are equivalent decompositions used for policy selection. ([PubMed Central][4])

For **QAI**, keep the same semantics with quantum carriers:

* **Outcomes** under (\pi): (p_\pi(o)=\mathrm{Tr}!\left(\mathcal I_o^{(\pi)}(\rho)\right)).
* **Extrinsic / risk term**: divergence between predicted outcomes and preferred outcomes (p^*): (D_{\mathrm{KL}}!\left(p_\pi(\cdot),|,p^*(\cdot)\right)).
* **Epistemic / intrinsic term**: expected **information gain** about latent quantum states—use mutual information between measurement outcomes and the state, based on von Neumann entropy / quantum relative entropy (data-processing and SSA apply). ([Wikipedia][5])

This sits cleanly under the **quantum FEP** (a formulation of the Free Energy Principle for generic quantum systems), which justifies reading EFE as a Bayesian-prediction-error bound in quantum settings. ([PubMed][6])

> **Lean-friendly objective sketch**
> (G_\pi := \underbrace{D_{\mathrm{KL}}(p_\pi(o),|,p^*(o))}*{\text{risk/extrinsic}} ;-; \underbrace{I*\pi(o:\rho)}_{\text{epistemic info gain}}),
> with (I) computed from von Neumann entropies / quantum relative entropy; alternative Rényi-based variants are possible if you later prefer that thermodynamic family. ([Physical Review Journals][7])

# 5) Where each piece lives (files & tiny signatures)

* **`Quantum/ActiveInference.lean`** (new)

  * `structure QState (H) := ρ : Density H`  (positive, trace-1)
  * `structure Instrument (H) := maps : Outcome → CPTNI H  -- Σ_o maps o is CPTP`  
  * `def step (π : Policy H) : QState H → QState H := …`  (compose CP maps/instruments)
  * `def Jqai (U : Set (QState H)) : Set (QState H) := {ρ ∈ U | ∀π o, step_o π ρ ∈ U}`
  * Prove `Jqai` is a **nucleus** (deflationary/monotone/idempotent).
  * `def birth_J (U) : ℕ :=` first stabilisation index (you already outlined the proof shape). 
  * `def G (π) : ℝ := risk π - epistemic π` with classical risk on (p_\pi(o)) and quantum MI for epistemic.

* **Hook into your existing laws**

  * `Epistemic/Occam.lean`, `Logic/Psr.lean`, `Logic/Dialectic.lean`: reuse the *same* definitions and proofs with (J:=J_{\text{QAI}}). 
  * `Quantum/Orthomodular.lean` + `ProjectorNucleus.lean`: projections/PVMs as the orthomodular stage; POVMs as **effect algebra** stage. ([Wikipedia][1])
  * Bridges: `Clifford.lean` hosts Hilbert-/projector nuclei and the **lax-commutation** with `logicalShadow` you already use. 

# 6) Contracts & tests (short, decisive)

Add **`Tests/Quantum/ActiveInferenceSpec.lean`** with:

1. **PSR-stability**: if (U) invariant and (\rho\in U), then every instrument path keeps you in (U). (Reachability induction as in your PSR note.) 
2. **Dialectic join**: (J_{\text{QAI}}(T\cup A)) is least invariant containing both. 
3. **Occam minimality**: for a spec like “non-trivial coherence retained,” the minimal-birthday invariant is selected. 
4. **EFE sanity**: for toy instruments, show softmax over (-G_\pi) prefers policies that reduce outcome risk and increase information gain (matching classical AIF decompositions). ([PubMed Central][4])

# 7) Why this is principled (and future-proof)

* **QAI ≡ your nucleus viewpoint**: QAI’s “perceive–act–update” becomes an **interior on sets** of quantum states—so **Occam/PSR/Dialectic** are literally the same theorems you already planned for (J,\theta) .
* **Soundness**: effect-algebra/orthomodular carriers, CPTP dynamics, Petz/Bayes, and von Neumann/relative entropy give you standard QIT semantics for updates and information. ([Wikipedia][1])
* **External justification**: the **quantum FEP** literature explicitly motivates free-energy/evidence bounds for quantum agents, so EFE-based policies are principled in this stage too. ([PubMed][6])

---

## Immediate next steps (surgical)

1. Add `Quantum/ActiveInference.lean` with `Jqai` + the three laws (Occam/PSR/Dialectic) instantiated for QAI. Wire `birth_J`. 
2. Extend `StageSemantics.lean` with **effect**/**orthomodular** examples using POVMs/PVMs and show the promised commuting lemmas with `logicalShadow`. 
3. Introduce `Tests/Quantum/…` covering the four bullets above. Your CI already encodes “compiled = proven”. 

If you want, I can draft those Lean stubs next.
