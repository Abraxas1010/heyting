Amazing direction. I took your draft and refactored it into a **Lean-first, repo-ready spec** that plugs cleanly into your LoF/Heyting nucleus stack and four-lens bridges. Each innovation now has: (a) the precise fit to your core (`R`, `Ω_R`, dial θ, RT/TRI contracts), (b) minimal Lean scaffolding you can drop into your tree, and (c) proof/acceptance criteria that keep `lake build -- -Dno_sorry -DwarningAsError=true` green.

# Crypto innovations—rewritten to fit your system

## 1) Nucleus-Controlled Homomorphic Evaluation (FHE abstraction)

**Fit to your stack.** In the **tensor lens**, treat the homomorphic “refresh” as the **lens-level interior** `Int` (inflationary, idempotent, meet-preserving). The Heyting ops transport pointwise, so scripted homomorphic steps are just lens ops followed by `Int` (your RT-2 law). The dial **θ** tracks “noise budget”; when θ crosses a threshold, apply `Int` (= abstract bootstrap) and keep semantics equal on `Ω_R`. Formulas already in your spec:
`χ_{a∧_R b}=min(χ_a,χ_b)`, `χ_{a∨_R b}=Int(max(χ_a,χ_b))`, `χ_{a⇒_R b}=Int(max(1-χ_a,χ_b))`, `χ_{¬_R a}=Int(1-χ_a)`. 

**Lean surface (new files).**

* `lean/Crypto/FHE/NucleusEval.lean`

  * `class FHELens (Cipher : Type) [HeytingCore Ω_R] := (Int : Cipher → Cipher) …`
  * `def enc : Ω_R → Cipher` / `def dec : Cipher → Ω_R`
  * Lemma **RT-2-FHE:** `enc (a ⋄_R b) = Int (enc a ⋄ enc b)`; **RT-1:** `dec ∘ enc = id` on `Ω_R`. 

**Proof/acceptance.**

* Prove `Int`’s nucleus axioms and **pointwise Heyting adjunction** at the tensor level (already stated in your acceptance notes). 
* Wire into `Tests/Compliance.lean` under a “homomorphic-step” suite (no new axioms). Build must stay green per your **build contract**. 

> Scope note: This is a **semantic FHE model** (correctness under interiorization). Mapping to a concrete RLWE bootstrap remains a separate engineering layer.

## 2) Multi-Lens Zero-Knowledge with Shadow Commutation

**Fit to your stack.** You already have **round-trip contracts** and **TRI** laws. Use `logicalShadow : statement → Ω_R` to **prove once in the core**, then **encode** the same witness into any lens (tensor/graph/Clifford). Verifiers check any one lens; **equivalence** follows from RT-contracts and cross-lens contracts (RT-1/RT-2, TRI-1/2).  

**Lean surface (new files).**

* `lean/Crypto/ZK/LensProofs.lean`

  * `structure ProofTensor …` / `ProofGraph …` / `ProofClifford …`
  * `theorem lens_equiv : verify tensor ↔ verify graph ↔ verify clifford` (discharged by RT/TRI automation).

**Proof/acceptance.**

* Use your **TRI-1/2** contracts and one-table mapping to keep laws intact after encoding/interiorization.  

> Trusted setup caveat: this makes lens equivalence **machine-checked**; it doesn’t remove a SNARK’s setup if your chosen scheme has one—it makes the gadget mapping **formally verified and lens-agnostic**.

## 3) Dial-Parameterized “Constant-Time” Lattice Ops (algebraic CT)

**Fit to your stack.** Use **stage semantics** + dial θ to select **branch-free fixed-point ops** (operate only inside the `Int/J`-fixed locus at higher θ). That yields an **algebraic constant-time** guarantee: no data-dependent control flow in the logic of evaluation because all joins/implications are interiorized and monotone. This matches your staged automation on bridges. 

**Lean surface (new files).**

* `lean/Crypto/Lattice/Stages.lean`

  * `def fast_reduce := operate_at DialParam.boolean`
  * `def ct_reduce   := operate_at DialParam.orthomodular`
  * Lemma `ct_no_branch`: ops at high θ are compositions of meet + interiorized joins ⇒ monotone, branch-free in the algebraic model. (Proof uses lens adjunction + nucleus laws.)

**Proof/acceptance.**

* Show **TRI** holds at each stage; add a “no if on secrets” meta-check as a **contract** on allowed combinators. (Microarchitectural side-channels remain an implementation concern; here we pin down the **algebraic CT** property.)

---

## 4) Verifiable Secret Sharing on Alexandroff Opens

**Fit to your stack.** In the **graph lens**, take secrets as **down-sets** (Alexandroff opens) of the re-entry preorder; shares are interiorized neighborhoods; reconstruction is interiorized union. The Heyting ops and adjunction are already specified for opens.  

**Lean surface (new files).**

* `lean/Crypto/VSS/Alexandroff.lean`

  * `def Secret := Opens (X, ≼_R)`; `def share i := Int (secret ∩ nbr i)`
  * `theorem reconstruct (T : Finset Node) : Int (⋃ i∈T, share i) = secret` (dial can parametrize threshold).

**Proof/acceptance.**

* Verify closure of ops under a graph interior `Int_G` mirroring `R` (your acceptance points). 

---

## 5) Quantum–Classical Hybrid via Projector Nucleus `J`

**Fit to your stack.** In the **projector/Clifford lens**, define the operator nucleus
`J(A) = Proj( ∫_G U_g A U_g^{-1} dμ(g) )` (inflationary, idempotent, meet-preserving on the commutant). Use `J(span)` for joins; implication/negation via `J(¬A ∪ B)`. This is exactly your “geometry/Clifford” bridge with a clean constructive ↔ orthomodular boundary.  

**Lean surface (new files).**

* `lean/Crypto/Quantum/Projector.lean`

  * `def J : Op → Op := …`
  * Lemmas: `inflationary`, `idempotent`, `map_meet` (commutant).
  * Contracts: `join := J ∘ span`, `impl := J (¬A ∪ B)`.
* Optional: `lean/Contracts/Crypto.lean`—centralizes **RT-1/RT-2** for all crypto carriers.

**Proof/acceptance.**

* Prove `J` is a nucleus and the fixed-point locus forms a Heyting algebra; document the classical limit `J = id` and constructive regimes otherwise. 

---

## Global contracts (already in your plan)

* **RT-1 (Identity on the core):** `dec ∘ enc = id` on `Ω_R`. **RT-2 (Homomorphism up to interiorization):** lens ops followed by `Int/J`. Wire these into every crypto carrier.  
* **TRI-1/2/3 (Reasoning triad):** residuation soundness in the core and lens-level equality post-interiorization (table + contracts already written).  
* **One-table mapping** (core ↔ tensor ↔ graph ↔ projector) for meet/join/impl/neg—use this as the proof authority for all per-lens crypto proofs. 

---

## Repo drops & acceptance checklist

**Add these modules (minimal stubs OK):**

* `Crypto/FHE/NucleusEval.lean`
* `Crypto/ZK/LensProofs.lean`
* `Crypto/Lattice/Stages.lean`
* `Crypto/VSS/Alexandroff.lean`
* `Crypto/Quantum/Projector.lean`
* `Contracts/Crypto.lean` (glues RT/TRI across carriers)

**Update tests/docs:**

* `Tests/Compliance.lean`: add `Crypto` suites under tensor/graph/Clifford.
* `Docs/ProofNotes.md`: record the crypto contracts + counterexamples (e.g., why non-interiorized joins break adjunction).
* Keep CI strict: `lake build -- -Dno_sorry -DwarningAsError=true`. 

**Why this now composes cleanly with your system.**
Everything above is expressed **entirely in nucleus/Heyting and lens transports** you already maintain (ModalDial, StageSemantics, Bridges, Cross-Lens Contracts). No new axioms; it reuses your automation and directory layout.  

If you want, I can turn this into a short `Docs/CryptoStack.md` (5–7 pages) with the exact lemma statements you’ll prove and a tiny worked example per lens.
