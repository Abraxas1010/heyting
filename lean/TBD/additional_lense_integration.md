Absolutely—using your “pick a carrier + choose a meet-preserving hull (I)” recipe, there are several more lenses that slot in cleanly next to tensors, graphs, topology/geometry, and operator/Clifford. (That four-lens pattern is already set up in your paper/plan, and the generic transport trick—close ∨/⇒/¬ with (I)—is exactly what we’ll reuse below.   )

Here are 8 generative fits, each with a carrier and a nucleus (I) you can drop into the same contracts (RT-1/RT-2) and Boolean limit story:

1. Sheaf / Topos (Lawvere–Tierney modality)
   Carrier: subobjects over a site (presheaves/sheaves).
   Nucleus (I): sheafification (or more generally, (j)-closure from a Lawvere–Tierney topology); it’s idempotent, extensive, and meet-preserving (left exact).
   Use: locality/gluing; perfect for “local proofs ⇒ global object” and for HoTT-style modalities (also matches your earlier HoTT ambitions).
   Lean hook: `Bridges/Sheaf.lean` with a small `HasJTopology` class and `closeJoin := sheafify (¬a ∨ b)`.

2. Trace / Temporal (prefix-closed safety kernel)
   Carrier: sets of finite/ω-traces over an alphabet or LTS.
   Nucleus (I): `PrefHull` = largest prefix-closed subset containing X (a reflective sublattice; preserves ∩).
   Use: safety properties (invariants) as fixed points; synthesis is closed union under `PrefHull`.
   Lean hook: `Bridges/Temporal.lean` with `PrefHull : Set Trace → Set Trace`.

3. Rewriting / Multiway (Ruliad-flavored)
   Carrier: sets of terms/graphs under a one-step rewrite preorder ( \Rightarrow ).
   Nucleus (I): upward-closure `UpHull_⇒(X) = { y | ∃x∈X, x ⇒* y }` (idempotent, extensive, meet-preserving for preorders).
   Use: abduction/induction across rewrite cones; joins and implication closed by `UpHull_⇒`.
   Lean hook: `Bridges/Rewrite.lean` with a `Rewrites` structure and `upHull`.

4. Abstract Interpretation (best abstraction interior)
   Carrier: properties ordered by precision; adjunction ( \alpha \dashv \gamma ).
   Nucleus (I): the interior (I := \alpha ∘ \gamma) on the abstract poset (idempotent, extensive on the abstract side, meet-preserving because (\alpha) preserves finite meets).
   Use: verified program reasoning; “explain” (Occam) = earliest invariant in the abstract domain.
   Lean hook: `Bridges/AbsInt.lean` with `class GaloisConnection` and `def interior := α ∘ γ`.

5. Ordered-Vector / Cone (resource & budgets)
   Carrier: ( \mathbb{R}^n ) (or actions) ordered by a closed convex cone (K) (e.g., costs ≥ 0).
   Nucleus (I): order upward-closure `UpHull_K(X) = { y | ∃x∈X, x ≤_K y }` (preserves ∩).
   Use: AgentPMT-native: budgets and refinements (splits/aggregations) as invariants; Boolean limit when (K={0}).
   Lean hook: `Bridges/Cone.lean` with `structure Cone` and `upHullK`.

6. Causal DAG / SCM (ancestral hull)
   Carrier: node sets in a DAG with reachability.
   Nucleus (I): `AncestralHull(S)` = all ancestors of (S) (an upward-closure in the reachability preorder).
   Use: constructive causal reasoning; implication closed by `AncestralHull(¬A ∪ B)`.
   Lean hook: `Bridges/Causal.lean` with `ancestralHull : Set V → Set V`.

7. Petri Nets / Event Structures (configuration hull)
   Carrier: configurations closed under causality/conflict rules.
   Nucleus (I): `ConfHull` = least configuration superset (reflective, meet-preserving).
   Use: concurrency and resource synchronization; synthesis = close(T ∪ A) under enabling.
   Lean hook: `Bridges/Petri.lean` with `confHull`.

8. Homotopy / Modal Truncations (HoTT)
   Carrier: subtypes/propositions-as-types with modal operator (|{-}|_n).
   Nucleus (I): (n)-truncation (idempotent, extensive, meet-preserving in the modal subuniverse).
   Use: collapse higher structure to a constructive core; “dimension dial” matches your classicalization path.
   Lean hook: `Bridges/HoTT.lean` with a `Trunc n`-style interface and `closeJoin := trunc (¬a ∨ b)`.

Why these fit your stack

* They all instantiate the same transport recipe—define (∧_R := ∧); define (\lor_R, ⇒_R, ¬_R) by closing with the lens-specific (I)—so RT-1/RT-2 drop in unchanged. 
* They preserve your “dial”/classical-limit narrative (stronger (I) ⇒ more constructive; weaken (I) toward id ⇒ more classical), exactly like your current dimension dial. 
* They match your existing “Bridges/*” shape and compliance harness (drop-in carriers; same round-trip contracts). 

If you want, I can sketch one of these as a minimal Lean bridge (module skeleton + `I` + `@[simp]` rules) and wire it into `Contracts/` so it compiles under your strict build contract.
