Here’s a tight comparison + an integration map that plugs the new Koopman-control results into your Lean/LoF stack in ways that add real capability—without breaking your current proofs.

# Quick take

Your system already gives you a **Lean-verified Heyting core from a re-entry nucleus** and **law-preserving transports** to tensors/graphs/Clifford, with RT/TRI round-trip contracts and Occam/PSR/Dialectic baked in. The new paper unifies two major Koopman-for-control formalisms—**infinite input-sequence Koopman** vs **Koopman Control Family (KCF)**—and shows how to pass information between them via clean **domain restriction/extension operators**. That’s a perfect on-ramp for a **fifth lens: a Koopman lens**, with a nucleus defined as an *invariance hull* over input policies. This gives you verified reasoning over controlled dynamics (reachability, invariants, MPC scaffolds) inside the same Ω_R logic you already trust.

## What you already have (relevant bits)

* **Re-entry as a nucleus R**; fixed-point locus Ω_R carries a **Heyting algebra** with ∧ preserved, and ∨/⇒/¬ closed by R. Transports to tensors, Alexandroff opens, geometry, and operator/Clifford satisfy **RT-1/RT-2** and the **reasoning triad (residuation)**. The **Euler boundary** example and the **dimension dial** show how constructive → classical limits are managed. (See abstract + §2–5; also the one-table summary.) 
* Your **plan doc** mirrors this and codifies the build contract, cross-lens contracts (RT-1/RT-2/TRI-1/TRI-2), and compliance harness. That’s the anchor we’ll extend. 

## What the new research adds (what to import)

* It **proves equivalence** between two control extensions of Koopman: (i) a **single operator on X×ℓ(U)** (infinite input sequences) and (ii) the **KCF** (a family {K_{u*}} on X). The bridge is via linear **restriction/extension** maps between function spaces, with **control-independent observables** as the shared backbone. (Definitions §4, §7; operator connections Theorems **8.2** and **8.4**; **Fig. 2** on p. 11 shows the commutative diagram; **Fig. 3** on p. 12 shows the KCF↔augmented connection.) 
* It also explains **why naive input-handling fails** (domain mismatch; “input ≠ state”), which tells us exactly where a closure operator must sit. (See §3 “A cautionary tale”.)

## Integration map: 7 concrete upgrades

1. ### Add a **Koopman lens** (new carrier)

   **Carrier.** Functions on X (KCF view) or on X×ℓ(U) (∞-sequence view).
   **Nucleus (R_K).** Define the **invariance hull** over input choices: for a property P (subset of X or a predicate/observable), let
   [
   R_K(P)=\bigcap{W \mid W\supseteq P,\ \forall u^*,\ T_{u^*}(W)\subseteq W}
   ]
   (robust forward-invariance under all constant inputs). This operator is **extensive, idempotent, and meet-preserving** (intersection of invariants), so it is a **nucleus** and Ω_{R_K} is a Heyting core—plug-compatible with your transports. Result: a verified logic for **controlled** systems inside your existing residuation triad. (KCF basics §4.B; operator family Ku*.) 

2. ### RT/TRI for the Koopman lens via **restriction/extension**

   Use the paper’s restriction/extension maps to build **enc/dec** that commute with dynamics:

   * **Infinite-sequence side:** Theorem **8.2** shows (R_{F^{aug}}^{F^\infty}K_\infty=K_{aug}R_{F^{aug}}^{F^\infty}) and (K_{aug}=R_{F^{aug}}^{F^\infty}K_\infty E_{F^\infty}^{F^{aug}}). That gives your RT-style **round-trip** on the Koopman lens (enc := extension, dec := restriction). See **diagram on p. 11**. 
   * **KCF side:** Theorem **8.4** gives the analogous commuting squares with Ku*; **diagram on p. 12**. 
     Wire this into your existing **RT-1/RT-2/TRI** test harness so all lenses share the same guarantees. 

3. ### Map **Occam/PSR/Dialectic** to control

   * **PSR ↔ invariance:** PSR is “R(P)=P”; in the Koopman lens, that literally means **forward-invariant** sets under all inputs. Your PSR lemmas port directly. 
   * **Dialectic ↔ closed union:** synthesis S = R(T ∪ A); in control terms, the **least invariant superset** containing two specifications. (Your dialectic law remains intact with R→R_K.) 
   * **Occam (minimal birthday) ↔ minimal invariance depth:** reuse your Occam≤k family to pick **earliest-stabilizing controlled invariants** (smallest iteration index of R_K). This gives a **principled model order/feature budget** for Koopman lifts. 

4. ### Verified **reachability/safety** inside Ω_{R_K}

   With R_K as a nucleus, the Heyting implication (A⇒_{R_K}C=R_K(¬A∨C)) becomes a **sound abduction rule for control constraints** (what hypotheses make C achievable regardless of u?). That drops straight into your residuation-based **deduction/abduction/induction** lemmas. 

5. ### **Input-state separable** finite forms with proof guardrails

   KCF’s finite form (\Psi(x^+)\approx A(u)\Psi(x)) (input-state separable) is a unifying wrapper for linear/bilinear/switched lifts. Use your **Occam≤k** to choose the smallest Ψ that keeps **RT/TRI** green; store the **invariance-proximity**/error-bound facts as side conditions in proofs. (See §4.B Remark 4.6; discussion around finite forms and error guarantees.) 

6. ### New **compliance tests**: “Naive input fails” → guardrail lemma

   Port §3’s domain-mismatch results into a lemma that **forbids** encodings that treat input as state without closure—exactly the counterexample your transports need to catch. That strengthens your **guardrails** alongside “why we must close joins/implications with I.” (Your guardrails §10; paper §3.)  

7. ### **Visualization**: add a Koopman pane to your proof-graph widget

   Show the commuting squares (**Fig. 2 & Fig. 3**) as live diagrams: click a node in one framework to see the corresponding function via restriction/extension in the other. This keeps your “multi-view” story coherent across the new lens. (Your visualization workbench + the paper’s diagrams.)

## Where to hook this in your repo (minimal churn)

* **`Bridges/Koopman.lean`** (new): a `KoopmanFamily` structure (state space X, inputs U, maps (T_{u^*})) + definitions of **Pre_{u^*}**, **Inv_All**, and the **nucleus (R_K)** as the least Inv_All superset (prove extensive/idempotent/meet-preserving). Then `instance : Heyting Ω_{R_K}`. (Mirrors your existing bridge pattern.) 
* **`Contracts`**: add **RT-K** (enc/dec = extension/restriction) and **TRI** proofs using the commuting identities from **Thms 8.2/8.4**. 
* **`Tests/Compliance.lean`**:

  1. “Naive input ≠ state” negative test (paper §3).
  2. Occam≤k selection stabilizes under (R_K).
  3. Euler-boundary analogue under control (smallest nontrivial controlled invariant).  

---

## Risks & how the nucleus fixes them

* **Input handling pitfalls.** The paper shows why direct composition fails for multi-step evolution unless you close the domain properly; your **nucleus pattern** is exactly the mathematically correct fix. (See §3 + §7 mapping operators.) 
* **Non-commutativity/approximation.** Keep your existing **guardrails**: close joins and implications with the appropriate I/J-style operator; track when you’re back in the constructive locus. (Your §10 guardrails.) 

---

## Why this adds value (net new capability)

* Brings **control-aware reasoning** (invariance, reachability, MPC scaffolds) into your already verified **LoF logic**, with reusable RT/TRI machinery.
* Gives you a **principled model-order selector** (Occam≤k) for Koopman lifts.
* Keeps everything **Lean-verified** under your strict **no-sorry, warnings-as-errors** build contract. 

If you want, I can sketch the Lean signatures for `KoopmanFamily`, `Inv_All`, and `R_K`, plus one RT-K proof, but the outline above should be enough to start the bridge cleanly.
