Here’s the same style of “compare → integrate” pass, now for the new **HoloBrain/HoloGraph** paper (oscillatory synchronization + Kuramoto control on graphs). 

# Quick take

* **What’s new in the paper:** it replaces heat-diffusion message passing with **oscillator synchronization** on a sphere (Kuramoto dynamics) and adds an **attending-memory control** term (Y) that acts like outcome-specific feedback. The update laws (their Eqs. (2)–(3)) and the tangent-space projection (ϕ) are explicit; the energy (E) is a Lyapunov function with (dE/dt \le 0). Figures 7–8 show stability to **128 layers** and the projection geometry.  
  *Page callouts:* the **diagram on page 11 (Fig. 8)** depicts (ϕ) as a tangent-space projection and the GST→CFC pipeline; **page 9 (Fig. 7g)** shows accuracy staying flat as depth grows; **page 13 (Table 1)** contrasts heat diffusion vs. oscillatory synchronization and “attention via control.”   
* **Why this fits your stack:** your re-entry/nucleus framework already supplies a constructive **Heyting core** with **law-preserving transports** (RT-1/RT-2, TRI) and guardrails per lens; a Kuramoto-style **Oscillation lens** drops in cleanly as another carrier with its own nucleus.

# Integration map — 7 concrete upgrades

1. ### Add an **Oscillation/Kuramoto lens**

   **Carrier:** phase states on the unit sphere per node, with coupling (K_{ij}) from the graph. **Dynamics:**
   ( \dot{x}*i=\omega_i+\rho,ϕ*{x_i}!\Big(\sum_j K_{ij}x_j\Big)) and with control (Y): ( \dot{x}*i=\omega_i+\rho,ϕ*{x_i}\big(y_i+\sum_{j\ne i}K_{ij}x_j\big)). 
   **Nucleus (R_{\text{sync}}):** define it as the **invariance hull under Kuramoto flow**, e.g., the least superset closed under the flow and lying in a target synchrony band (or sublevel of (E)). Because intersections of forward-invariant sets are invariant, (R_{\text{sync}}) is extensive/idempotent/**meet-preserving**, hence a nucleus; you then inherit a Heyting core on (Ω_{R_{\text{sync}}}). (Matches your nucleus recipe and Heyting construction.) 

2. ### Use the **Lyapunov energy** as the proof lever

   The paper proves the control-augmented Kuramoto model is the **gradient flow** of (E(x,Y)=\sum_{ij}x_i^\top K_{ij}x_j-\sum_i y_i^\top x_i) with (dE/dt\le0). Treat **(E)-sublevel sets** as certified invariants inside the oscillation lens; plug them into your PSR/dialectic laws and residuation triad. 
   Mapping to your logic: **PSR ≙ invariance** (R(P)=P); **Dialectic ≙ closed union** (R(T\cup A)) as the least invariant superset; **triad** gives deduction/abduction/induction on these controlled invariants. 

3. ### Round-trip & triad contracts for the new lens

   Define `enc` as (state → sphere) with GST pre-lift (if present) and `dec` as phase-thresholding followed by (R_{\text{sync}}). Show **RT-1** (`dec ∘ enc = id` on (Ω_R)) and **RT-2** (lens connectives commute up to the lens nucleus), mirroring your existing transports. Use the paper’s **projection-on-sphere** (ϕ) geometry to justify closure under operations.  

4. ### Import the **GST→CFC** sub-lens (optional but powerful)

   Their pipeline builds **graph wavelet** features (GST) and **cross-frequency coupling (CFC)** matrices before synchronization (Fig. 8). Model this as a **pre-processing sub-lens** with its own open-hull/nucleus, then feed its output to the oscillation lens. This adds interpretable **interference patterns** as invariants you can reason about.  

5. ### Treat **attending-memory (Y)** as a first-class “control field”

   In HoloGraph, (Y) is **feedback control** (attention) driving synchronization; Table 1 contrasts this with standard attention. Represent (Y) inside your logic as hypotheses in **abduction**: find (Y^\star) with (A⇒*{R*{\text{sync}}}C) satisfied (goal-directed synchrony). This gives a verified route to **controllability-aware** graph learning.  

6. ### Hardening your **graph lens** against over-smoothing

   One reason to add this lens: the paper shows performance stays stable **to 128 layers**, precisely because the dynamics **synchronize (don’t diffuse)**. Add compliance tests that (i) compare diffusion vs. oscillation message passing and (ii) assert invariants remain within the (E)-sublevel hull.  

7. ### Visualization pane (multi-view)

   Extend your proof-graph widget with **phase-space rings** (per Fig. 7f) and **CFC striping** overlays (per Fig. 6), wired to proof objects: clicking an invariant shows its (E) sublevel and measured KOP/synchrony. This aligns with your existing multi-view workbench.

# Where to hook this in your repo (minimal churn)

* **`Bridges/Oscillation/Kuramoto.lean` (new)**

  * `structure OscillatorState` on the unit sphere; `coupling : V → V → ℝ`.
  * `E : State → ℝ` and lemma `dE_dt_nonpos : along_flow E ≤ 0` (lens-level axiom, if needed).
  * `def R_sync : Set α → Set α :=` least forward-invariant superset under Kuramoto flow (prove extensive/idempotent/meet-preserving). This mirrors your nucleus pattern and yields `Heyting Ω_{R_sync}`. 

* **`Contracts/RT_Kuramoto.lean`**

  * `enc/dec` using GST→CFC (optional) + sphere normalization and thresholding; RT-1/RT-2/TRI proofs reuse your standard contract skeletons. 

* **`Tests/Compliance_Oscillation.lean`**

  * (i) **Over-smoothing guardrail:** show diffusion fails while oscillation keeps class separability with depth (cf. Fig. 7g).
  * (ii) **Lyapunov harness:** assert (E) monotonic decrease across steps.
  * (iii) **CFC fingerprints:** invariants survive GST→CFC pre-lens.  

* **Docs/Visuals**

  * Add “Oscillation lens” view modes to the LoF widget (phase rings, CFC stripe heatmaps), consistent with your current multi-view story.

# Why this adds net new capability

* **Control-aware reasoning** (choose (Y) to reach/maintain certified synchrony) inside your constructive logic—grounded by a Lyapunov proof knob. 
* **Depth-robust graph learning** (no over-smoothing) with formal invariants you can export through your existing round-trip contracts.  
* All of it plugs into your **no-sorry, warnings-as-errors** Lean build and existing cross-lens contracts.  

If you want, I can sketch the actual Lean signatures for `R_sync`, the `Lyapunov` lemma shell, and a minimal RT proof outline next.
