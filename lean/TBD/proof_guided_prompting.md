Here’s a tightened, system-native rewrite that aligns with your Lean layout, proof graph tooling, and PCT/ZK pipeline.

# Proof-Guided Generation via Dialectical Prompting

You’ve pinpointed a real failure mode in today’s LLM workflows and a way out that fits your stack exactly.

**Problem (status quo).** Prompting an LLM with plain natural language (“Pay vendor A”) sends it down the shortest statistical gradient to something that *looks* right but can be brittle or unsafe.

**Solution (your approach).** Precompute a **formally verified safe region** and make the model generate *inside it*. Instead of “find a path,” the LLM is told to **navigate a map you’ve already proved safe**—then emit an artifact that your verifier can deterministically accept or reject.

Concretely, your stack already provides the pieces:

* **Dialectic layer** to build the safe spec (Thesis/Antithesis → Synthesis) in Lean, under `Logic/Dialectic.lean`. 
* **Proof-graph export** so the spec becomes a machine-readable map (`LoFViz.Proof.Graph` + `graphJsonOfConstant`). 
* **Verified execution & transport** so compiled programs match the logical semantics across lenses (`compile_correct`, `transport_sound`).
* **ZK lowering** via the Boolean lens with R1CS export and CLI hooks (`pct_r1cs`).

## Architecture

### 1) Build the safe spec (Dialectical Synthesis)

1. **Thesis (`T`)** — parse the user’s goal (e.g., “Pay vendor A”) into your logical IR.
2. **Antithesis (`A`)** — collect known hazards (re-entrancy, budget overflow, policy violations).
3. **Synthesis (`S`)** — call the dialectic synthesis combinator in `Logic/Dialectic.lean` to produce the **minimal proposition that achieves `T` while ruling out `A`**. This is your *proof object/specification*, not a heuristic rule. 

### 2) Serialize the spec as a navigable map

Emit `S.json` using your proof-graph pipeline. `LoFViz.Proof.Graph` defines the node/edge schema; `graphJsonOfConstant` exposes a JSON payload your front-end and agents can consume. 

---

## The Dialectical Prompt (to the LLM)

> **You are constrained by a formal solution graph.**
> **Input:** `S.json` (the safe solution graph).
> **Task:** Produce a **Program** (`Prog` payload) that is a **valid traversal** of this graph. You **must** respect all node guards, edge pre/post-conditions, and state-transition rules.
> **Output format:** `progPayload.json` (schema: `Prog`, `Env`, `Trace` compatible with the PCT layer).

This flips generation from “open-ended synthesis” to **guided construction** inside a verified search space. The statistically “simple but wrong” path is literally absent.

---

## Two acceptance paths (deterministic, non-probabilistic)

### Path A — **Prog+VM** (proof-carrying by construction)

1. **LLM emits** `progPayload.json` that conforms to `S.json`.
2. **Verifier replay:** feed it to your proved VM / interpreter. The core theorem
   `compile_correct` + transport lemmas ensure the decoded output equals the logical spec—no heuristics, no trust. Any deviation (bad opcode, skipped check) fails at a specific instruction with a crisp error. 

*Where this lives in your plan:* `HeytingLean.Crypto` (IR, VM, compiler, correctness), with `transport_sound` across lenses. 

### Path B — **ZK (R1CS/SNARK)**

1. **LLM emits** a plan consistent with `S.json`.
2. **Lowering:** run `lake exe pct_r1cs form.json env.json` to export `r1cs.json` + `assignment.json` for standard provers. If the plan violates the logic, the exporter/prover cannot produce a valid proof.  
3. **Verify:** submit the resulting proof to your verifier (on-chain or off-chain). In this path, *success implies compliance by math*, not by opinion. The Boolean-lens arithmetization (`BoolLens` → gates, booleanity constraints) is already sketched and wired for soundness/completeness work. 

---

## Why this is robust

* **Spec-first, generation-second.** The proof object `S` defines the only admissible plans; the LLM can’t “luck into” a bad one because those edges don’t exist.
* **Deterministic acceptance.** Either the program replays under the proved VM (Path A) or a proof verifies (Path B). There’s no subjective review loop—**the formal layer *is* the review**. 
* **Unified across lenses.** Thanks to transport, the same logical spec works through tensor/graph/Clifford/Boolean realizations, keeping semantics aligned. 

---

## Minimal implementation notes (all in-repo)

* **Dialectic & laws present:** Occam/PSR/Dialectic are already implemented and tested in your logic layer—use them to generate `S`. 
* **Proof graph JSON:** use `LoFViz.Proof.Graph` + `graphJsonOfConstant` for `S.json`; keep the Lake build contract intact.
* **CLI hooks:** `pct_prove`, `pct_verify`, `pct_r1cs` are planned/standardized entry points in your PCT roadmap; wire them to the exact theorems.

## Drop-in prompt template

```
You are constrained by a formal solution graph.

1) Read S.json (safe solution graph). 
2) Produce progPayload.json that is a valid traversal of S.json.
3) Respect every guard and postcondition; do not invent nodes/edges.
4) Output ONLY valid Program JSON (no prose).

Schema hints: Prog/Env/Trace as in PCT; booleans where required; no NaNs.
```

---

**Bottom line:** your system can *generate with guarantees* by letting Lean compute the admissible region (`S`), exporting it as a proof graph, and forcing the LLM to operate *within it*, with deterministic acceptance via the VM path or the ZK path. This is precisely what your Formalization Plan and PCT roadmap were designed to enable.
