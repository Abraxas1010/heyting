# HeytingLean Formalization Suite

A Lean 4 development that formalises the Unified Generative Ontology programme: Laws of Form semantics, enriched bridge carriers, and interactive proof visualisation widgets.

## Getting Started

```bash
cd lean
lake update
lake build -- -Dno_sorry -DwarningAsError=true
```

- `lake build` produces the proof artifacts and ensures every widget compiles without `sorry`s.
- Run `lake env lean --run Main` to initialise the runtime bridge suite at the command line.

## Repository Layout

- `lean/` – primary Lean 4 project (`HeytingLean` library, widgets, docs, blueprints).
- `blueprint/` – LaTeX/HTML Laws of Form blueprint assets (plastex + print targets).
- `legacy_python/` – archived Python-first engine (bridges, GNN prototypes, tests, notebooks).
- `.lake/` – Lake build cache (regenerated by Lake).

## Lean Tooling Highlights

- Proof widgets and graph renderers live under `lean/HeytingLean/ProofWidgets`.
- Runtime contracts & bridges: `lean/HeytingLean/Contracts`, `lean/HeytingLean/Bridges`.
- Visual demos: `lean/VisualizationDemo.lean`, `lean/GraphProbe.lean`.
- Project documentation: `lean/Docs/` (status, ontology narrative, review notes, LoF blueprint output).

## Legacy Python Implementation

Historical Python sources now reside in `legacy_python/`. They remain untouched for reference but are no longer exercised by the build. If you need to run them:

```bash
cd legacy_python
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Contributing

1. Make changes inside `lean/`.
2. Keep `lake build -- -Dno_sorry -DwarningAsError=true` green.
3. Run `git status` from the repository root to confirm only intentional changes are staged.

The `master` branch tracks the Lean project; the archived Python code stays isolated to avoid accidental regressions.
