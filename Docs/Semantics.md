# MV / Effect / Orthomodular Synopsis

## MV Semantics (Łukasiewicz-style)
- Interpret truth values in the unit interval `[0,1]`. The identity nucleus captures the Boolean limit, while interior operators (e.g., pointwise clamps) give graded joins as seen in `tensor_encode_euler` examples.
- Future work: formalize a concrete `PrimaryAlgebra` instance for `[0,1]` with the Łukasiewicz t-norm and show how `Reentry` transports to tensors.

## Ladder Dimensional Semantics
- **Dial coordinates**: `Logic/ModalDial.lean` packages ladder slices via `Stage.DialParam`.  Each dial stage supplies MV identities (`mvAdd_zero_{left,right}`, `mvAdd_comm`) and exposes the Heyting interior carried by the LoF nucleus.
- **Collapse/expand**: `collapseAt` witnesses the projection from a dial stage down to the Heyting core, while `expandAt` lifts core data back to a chosen altitude.  Both operations respect the nucleus, and compliance tests assert round-trip stability (`collapseAt_expandAt`, `expandAt_collapseAt`).
- **Breathing & reachability**: `Logic/PSR.lean` supplies the `Step`, `reachable`, `breathe`, and `birth` APIs.  Lemmas such as `breathe_le_of_sufficient`, `sufficient_reachable`, and `reachable_collapse` ensure reasons propagate along breaths without leaving the nucleus.  `Tests/Compliance.lean` instantiates these facts for tensor/graph/projector ladders.
- **Dimensional slices**: ladder stages index constructive-to-classical drift (`Ω_{R₁} ⊆ Ω_{R₂} ⊆ ⋯`).  Collapses land inside the constructive base, while expansions track bias introduced by enriched carriers (intensity vectors, Alexandroff opens, projectors).
- **Narrative hooks** *(next steps)*: document how breathing sequences realise the Euler boundary story, add diagrams tying collapse/expand to dimensional re-entry, and produce worked examples that log stage transitions in compliance traces.

## Effect Algebra Connection
- The `clifford_encode_euler` example pairs Euler boundary data, hinting at effect-algebra behaviour (partial addition of orthogonal effects). The current projectors serve as the nucleus needed for effect-style reasoning.
- Future tasks: add partial addition + orthogonality lemmas to `Bridges/Clifford.lean`, mirroring standard effect-algebra axioms.

## Orthomodular Bridge
- Orthomodular behaviour is visible once we leave `Ω_R` and use the projector bridge. `eulerBoundary_complementary` + `clifford_encode_euler` provide the constructive core, while additional lemmas (to be written) can witness non-distributivity outside the fixed locus.
- Recommended follow-up: port existing orthomodular lattice facts from mathlib or author bespoke ones for `closed_subspace` projectors.

This note captures the roadmap for enriching MV/effect/orthomodular semantics without blocking the Phase 5 review.
