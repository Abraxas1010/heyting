# MV / Effect / Orthomodular Synopsis

## MV Semantics (Łukasiewicz-style)
- Interpret truth values in the unit interval `[0,1]`. The identity nucleus captures the Boolean limit, while interior operators (e.g., pointwise clamps) give graded joins as seen in `tensor_encode_euler` examples.
- Future work: formalize a concrete `PrimaryAlgebra` instance for `[0,1]` with the Łukasiewicz t-norm and show how `Reentry` transports to tensors.

## Stage Semantics Laws
- The `Stage.DialParam` API now exposes the canonical MV identities: `mvAdd_zero_left/ right` simplify joins with bottom and `mvAdd_comm` realises the Łukasiewicz symmetry at every ladder stage.
- Effect-style transport comes with `effectCompatible_orthocomplement` showing an element is compatible with its Heyting orthocomplement and `effectAdd?_orthocomplement` ensuring the partial sum is defined.
- Compliance exercises the Boolean, MV, effect, and orthomodular exemplars directly against these lemmas so bridge-specific witnesses stay aligned with the core definitions.

## Effect Algebra Connection
- The `clifford_encode_euler` example pairs Euler boundary data, hinting at effect-algebra behaviour (partial addition of orthogonal effects). The current projectors serve as the nucleus needed for effect-style reasoning.
- Future tasks: add partial addition + orthogonality lemmas to `Bridges/Clifford.lean`, mirroring standard effect-algebra axioms.

## Orthomodular Bridge
- Orthomodular behaviour is visible once we leave `Ω_R` and use the projector bridge. `eulerBoundary_complementary` + `clifford_encode_euler` provide the constructive core, while additional lemmas (to be written) can witness non-distributivity outside the fixed locus.
- Recommended follow-up: port existing orthomodular lattice facts from mathlib or author bespoke ones for `closed_subspace` projectors.

This note captures the roadmap for enriching MV/effect/orthomodular semantics without blocking the Phase 5 review.
